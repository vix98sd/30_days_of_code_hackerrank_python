Task
You are given two classes, Person and Student, where Person 
is the base class and Student is the derived class. Completed 
code for Person and a declaration for Student are provided 
for you in the editor. Observe that Student inherits all the 
properties of Person.

Complete the Student class by writing the following:
    A Student class constructor, which has 4 parameters:
    A string, firstName.
    A string, lastName.
    An integer, id.
    An integer array (or vector) of test scores, scores.
    A char calculate() method that calculates a Student object's 
    average and returns the grade character representative of 
    their calculated average:

Grades:
    O avg >= 90
    E avg >= 80
    A avg >= 70
    P avg >= 55
    D avg >= 40
    T avg < 40

Input Format
The locked stub code in your editor calls your Student class 
constructor and passes it the necessary arguments. It also 
calls the calculate method (which takes no arguments).
You are not responsible for reading the following input from stdin:
The first line contains firstName, lastName, and id, respectively. 
The second line contains the number of test scores. 
The third line of space-separated integers describes scores.

Constraints
1 <= |firstName|,|lastName| <= 10
|id| == 7
0 <= score, average <= 100

Output Format
This is handled by the locked stub code in your editor. 
Your output will be correct if your Student class constructor 
and calculate() method are properly implemented.
