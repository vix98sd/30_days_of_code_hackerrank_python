Task
Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1, 
print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 
2 space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer, T (the number of test cases).
Each line i of the T subsequent lines contain a String, S.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 10
2 <= length of S <= 10000

Output Format
For each String Sj (where 0 <= j <= T-1), print Sj's even-indexed characters, 
followed by a space, followed by Sj's odd-indexed characters.
