Task
Given an array, a, of size n distinct elements, sort the array in 
ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, 
print the following 3 lines:
    Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps.
    where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.
    First Element: firstElement
    where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.
    Last Element: lastElement
    where lastElement is the last element in the sorted array.
Hint: To complete this challenge, you will need to add a variable that 
keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of 
elements in array .
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing t
he respective values of a.

Constraints
2 <= n <= 600
1 <= ai <= 2*10^6, where 0 <= i <= n.

Output Format
Print the following three lines of output:
    Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps.
    where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.
    First Element: firstElement
    where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.
    Last Element: lastElement
    where lastElement is the last element in the sorted array.
